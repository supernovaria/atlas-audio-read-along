 * Aligns the spoken narration to the words printed on the page.

 * content that exists only in audio, for listeners who cannot see the page:
 * figure announcements ("The textbook includes Figure 1.2 here. It depicts
 * ..."), note-box skip-overs ("The textbook has a supplementary note titled
 * ..., which we'll skip over here"), and a section preamble naming the
 * chapter and section. Section 1.2 alone announces 22 figures.
 *
 * A sequential mapping (writtenIndex = spokenIndex - preambleOffset) cannot
 * survive that: each announcement shifts it by roughly nine words and the
 * error is permanent, so the highlight falls progressively further behind
 * and eventually runs off the end of the text.
 *
 * This aligner instead walks both streams together and, whenever they stop
 * agreeing, looks ahead for the nearest place where several words agree
 * again. Words with no counterpart are still given a sensible position, so
 * the highlight parks in place during an announcement rather than drifting.
