/**
 * Which audio file a section page plays, and whether it can be read along.
 *
 * Chapter 1 ships word-level timings (`src/data/ch1-timing.ts`) next to CBR
 * re-encoded MP3s. Those MP3s are gitignored -- large and reproducible -- so
 * whether they are present depends on who is building. Two sources can
 * therefore serve the same narration:
 *
 * - `cbr`: staged locally by `scripts/copy-ch1-audio.sh`. Constant bitrate
 *   makes a seek land exactly where the timings say, which is what clicking a
 *   word to jump there needs, so this one is preferred.
 * - `cdn`: the published file. A build with credentials resolves it into
 *   `section.audioLink`; for chapter 1 it is also pinned in the timing table,
 *   so a clone without credentials can still play the narration those timings
 *   were measured against. Same recording, so the read-along works either
 *   way; only seeking is coarser, because the published file is variable
 *   bitrate and browsers interpolate the seek position.
 *
 * With neither, the section has no audio and the page renders no player at
 * all, which is what a contributor build without credentials already does for
 * every other section. A player that loads a 404 is worse than no player.
 *
 * The published URL is hashed on the section *text*, so a TTS re-render
 * serves different audio from the same URL. The committed timings have to be
 * regenerated with it -- `pipeline.py --check-remote` in `atlas-podcast`
 * detects that the upstream audio moved.
