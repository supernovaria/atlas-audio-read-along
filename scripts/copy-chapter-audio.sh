# Stage a chapter's audio for local development.
#
# The CBR-re-encoded MP3s are large and gitignored, so a fresh clone has the
# timings but no audio and every page falls back to streaming the published
# file. That is fine for reading along, but seeking in a variable-bitrate MP3
# only lands near the word, so anything to do with click-to-seek wants the
# constant-bitrate copies this script produces.
#
# Two ways to get them, tried in this order:
#
#   1. Copy them out of the podcast pipeline's output directory, if it is
#      there. Byte-identical to what the timings were measured against.
#   2. Download the published audio and re-encode it here, which needs only
#      curl and ffmpeg. Same recording and same encoder settings as the
#      pipeline, so the decoded audio comes out bit-identical to it.
#
# It deliberately does NOT touch the committed .words.json files. A pipeline
# output directory can hold timings from a different transcription run: those
# track the same audio, but with slightly different word boundaries than the
# committed set the alignment was tuned and measured against. Refresh timings
# only on purpose, never as a side effect of staging audio.
#
# Name the sections you actually want to save the wait -- one is enough to
# compare seeking between the two sources.
